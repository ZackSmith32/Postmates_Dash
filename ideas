Add Data:
	1. create warning for time
		a) end is not after start
		b) durration is greater than x hours
		c) if I prepopulate with date, then logic for if the user does not change date when shift passes to the next day

Dashboard:
	1. when you click on the tile at the the top (hourly rate etc.)
		a) a box expands underneath that shows more details

	2. Daily earnings chart
		a) update the title so that it has a background an is not sitting in a panel (could just be to hid panel borders)
		b) checkboxes are too far left justified
		c) set up height of div so the the page doesn't jump around while the chart is loading.
		d) need to make sure charts keep formatting on resizing
		e) add rows for days where no deliveries were made, this way when we say
			show last 7 days it shows 7 days regardless of whether there was a 
			a delivery on the 7th day prior
