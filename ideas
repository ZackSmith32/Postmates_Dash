// create a function that gets all the possible outcomes
// for a field in the data base.  Then use this to create
// the filter options... decided meh

// make barDay and whatever other options are suitable
// into a list, and have it populated by checkboxes for
// data validation purposes

// need to make a way to set different times for different days

// filter for time will have to be improved such that
// when a bars hh is included in time then it is in the
// list, even if times are not equivalent.. should be easy w/
// > and <

// *** delete bars option

// $$$ note: when missing '(' often it is a result of a misspelling
// $$$ function is a popular misspelling for me
